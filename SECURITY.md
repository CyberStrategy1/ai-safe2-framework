## Reporting a Vulnerability
Since this is a Governance Framework, a "vulnerability" is defined as:
1.  **Logical Flaw:** A control that, if implemented, introduces a security risk.
2.  **Code Flaw:** A bug in the `safe2_server.py` MCP script or JSON schema.
3.  **Missing Critical Vector:** A widely exploited attack (e.g., DeepSeek Jailbreak) not covered by the current taxonomy.

### How to Report
Please **DO NOT** open a public GitHub Issue for critical code exploits (Zero-Days).
*   **Email:** `security@cyberstrategyinstitute.com`
*   **Subject:** `[SECURITY] - AI SAFE2 Vulnerability Report`

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
