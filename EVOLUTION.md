# AI SAFE² Framework Evolution History

This document outlines the strategic evolution of the AI SAFE² framework, detailing the transition from a conceptual foundation to an agentic governance engine.

## 🚀 Version 2.1: Advanced Agentic & Distributed AI Edition (Current)
**Released:** November 2025
**Core Concept:** "Mission Control for Autonomous Drones."

Version 2.1 transforms AI SAFE² into an Agentic GRC + Security blueprint. It integrates 30+ specialized "Gap Fillers" specifically designed to address swarm intelligence, Non-Human Identity (NHI) governance, and advanced memory security.

### Key Changes by Pillar
*   **Pillar 1 (Sanitize & Isolate):** Now includes OpenSSF Model Signing (OMS), real-time secret scanning (GitGuardian), and mitigation for memory attacks (AgentPoison). Isolation moves to Multi-Agent Boundary Enforcement and P2P trust scoring.
*   **Pillar 2 (Audit & Inventory):** Enhanced for Decision Traceability (reasoning chains) and SHA-256 state verification. Inventory now mandates Swarm Topology Maps and automated NHI Registries.
*   **Pillar 3 (Fail-Safe & Recovery):** Introduces Distributed Kill Switches for swarms and specific playbooks for context injection attacks. Recovery expands to HSM-integrated credential recovery.
*   **Pillar 4 (Engage & Monitor):** Formalizes human oversight for consensus failures and Just-In-Time (JIT) privilege elevation for agents. Monitoring now detects "ghost tokens" and poisoned vector embeddings.
*   **Pillar 5 (Evolve & Educate):** Focuses on agile consensus algorithms and updates to OMS specifications. Training now includes Swarm Manager Certification.

> **Analogy:** If v1.0 was a propeller plane, v2.1 is the advanced mission control center required to manage an entire fleet of autonomous drones, ensuring each drone (agent) has the right credentials, stays within its flight path, and can be instantly grounded if its internal logic is compromised.

## 🏢 Version 2.0: The Enterprise Operational Standard
**Released:** October 2025
**Core Concept:** "High-Tech Building Security."

The shift from v1.0 to v2.0 represented a move from a conceptual model to a granular, enterprise-grade operational framework. It expanded the 5 pillars into 99 detailed subtopics and integrated with NIST, OWASP, and MITRE ATLAS.

### Key Upgrades
*   **Architecture:** Introduced the Five-Layer Architecture Model covering the entire AI stack.
*   **Compliance:** Achieved 100% coverage of OWASP Top 10 for LLM and NIST AI RMF.
*   **Risk Scoring:** Introduced the Combined Risk Score formula (Vulnerability + Control Effectiveness).

### Evolution by Pillar
*   **P1:** Expanded to comprehensive input validation (schema enforcement, toxic content) and detailed boundary enforcement.
*   **P2:** Shifted to real-time activity logging, bias monitoring, and automated SBOM generation.
*   **P3:** Transitioned to advanced resilience controls (circuit breakers) and formal RTO/RPO management.
*   **P4:** Formalized "human-in-the-loop" into structured oversight and real-time SIEM integration.
*   **P5:** Transformed training into a culture-building program with specialized operator education.

## 🏛️ Version 1.0: The Foundational Structure
**Released:** June 2025
**Core Concept:** "The Blueprint."

The original conceptual foundation that established the **S-A-F-E-E** methodology.
*   Provided the core philosophy of securing AI.
*   Established the 5-Pillar structure.
*   Identified the top 10 core topics for AI security.

### 📊 Summary of Transition (1.0 → 2.1)
The framework has transitioned from **securing AI as a tool** (v1.0) to **governing AI as an autonomous workforce** (v2.1). We have moved from generic sandboxing to cryptographic state verification, and from simple human oversight to distributed consensus protocols.
