## 🏗️ Topic 7: Engage (P4.T7)
*Human Oversight, Intervention, Interaction*

### Core Controls (v2.0)
*   **[P4.T7.1] Human Approval Workflows:** HITL for high-risk decisions; define approval authorities.
*   **[P4.T7.2] Explainability:** Provide reasoning chains; implement interpretability techniques.
*   **[P4.T7.3] Interactive Feedback:** RLHF loops; track feedback metrics.
*   **[P4.T7.4] Escalation Procedures:** Route alerts based on severity; integrate with incident mgmt.
*   **[P4.T7.5] Real-Time Intervention:** Enable override controls; provide visibility dashboards.
*   **[P4.T7.6] User Interaction Oversight:** Monitor for abuse/malice; track trust metrics.
*   **[P4.T7.7] Red Teaming:** Regular adversarial testing; validate security controls.
*   **[P4.T7.8] Risk Acceptance:** Establish acceptance procedures; document compensating controls.
*   **[P4.T7.9] Collaboration Tools:** Shared dashboards for Governance/Sec/Eng.
*   **[P4.T7.10] Transparency Reporting:** Report incidents and risks to stakeholders.

### 🚀 v2.1 Advanced Gap Fillers
*   **[P4.T1.1_ADV] Multi-Agent Approval:**
    *   **Consensus Failure Escalation:** Human review when agents disagree.
    *   **High-Risk Action Approval:** Human gate for financial/system actions.
*   **[P4.T1.2_ADV] NHI Privilege Review:**
    *   **JIT Access:** Human approval for temporary privilege elevation.
    *   **Baseline Validation:** Check requests against established baselines.

*   **[P4.T8.10] Compliance Logs:** Maintain specific logs for regulatory audits.

### 🚀 v2.1 Advanced Gap Fillers
*   **[P4.T2.1_ADV] Distributed Agent Monitoring:**
    *   **Health Metrics:** Monitor availability/responsiveness of agents.
    *   **Consensus Tracking:** Track agreement rates and swarm topology.
*   **[P4.T2.2_ADV] NHI Monitoring:**
    *   **Real-Time Dashboard:** Display NHI activity.
    *   **Behavioral Anomalies:** Detect unusual API calls/geo-locations.
*   **[P4.T2.3_ADV] Memory Poisoning Monitor:**
