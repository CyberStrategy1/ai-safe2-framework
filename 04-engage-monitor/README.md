# Pillar 4: Engage & Monitor
### 📡 The Control Room

[🔙 Back to Main Framework](../README.md)

## 🎯 Objective
Maintain active oversight of AI systems through real-time monitoring, human-in-the-loop intervention, and behavioral analysis.

## 🏗️ Core Controls (v2.1)

### 4.1 Human Oversight
*   **[P4.T7.1] Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** High-impact actions (financial, data deletion) require explicit human approval.
*   **[P4.T7.5] Real-Time Intervention:** Operators can inject system instructions into a running agent session.

### 4.2 Anomaly Detection
*   **[P4.T8.1] Performance Dashboards:** Monitor latency, token jitter, and error rates.
*   **[P4.T8.4] Drift Detection:** Alert on degradation in model accuracy or safety guardrail/refusal rates.

## 🚀 v2.1 Advanced Gap Fillers

### 🔑 Privilege Elevation (Gap Filler #4)
*   **[P4.T1.2_ADV] Just-in-Time (JIT) Access:** Agents request temporary admin privileges which must be approved by a human.

### 🧠 Cognitive Integrity (Gap Filler #5)
*   **[P4.T2.3_ADV] Embedding Drift:** Monitor vector space for semantic shifts indicating memory injection attacks.
