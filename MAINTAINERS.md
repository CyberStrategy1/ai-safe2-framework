# Maintainers

The **AI SAFE² Framework** is architected and maintained by the **Cyber Strategy Institute**.

While we welcome community contributions via the [RFC Process](CONTRIBUTING.md), the strategic direction of the framework is governed by the Core Maintainers to ensure strict alignment with ISO 42001 and NIST standards.

## Core Maintainers
*   **Vincent Sullivan** (@csi-founder) - *Lead Architect & Founder*
*   **Cyber Strategy Institute** - *Governance Board*

## Governance Model
*   **Minor Changes:** (Typos, broken links) - Merged by community consensus.
*   **Major Changes:** (New Controls, Structural Pillars) - Require approval from the Lead Architect and validation against the 5-Pillar Matrix.
